# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Course Links**
* [2020 Python Bootcamp - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
* [Bioinformatics Algorithms - Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/2)

### Day 1: 11.07.2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learnt the basics of objects and data structures in Python
* Installed Anaconda and Jupyter
* Completed the first code challenge in the Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC
  * Objective --> identify the number of times a k-mer appears in a base sequence when given the k-mer base sequence
* Wrote my first program in Python

**Thoughts** This is my first time coding. I spent many hours picking up the basic skills needed to approach and solve the bioinformatic code challenge. Finally solving the algorithm challenge was the perfect end to today.

### Day 2: 12.07.2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learnt about Python arrays, lists, dictionaries, and tuples as part of the Udemy course
* Wrote a function that identifies the most common substrings (suspected DnaA boxes) in a genome base sequence
* Wrote a function that finds the location of a specific k-mer in a genome

**Thoughts** These coding challenges were built upon yesterday's knowledge so I found writing today's functions quite intuitive

### Day 3: 13.07.2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Scored highly on the first Udemy course assessment
* Wrote a function that identifies the most common substrings (suspected DnaA boxes) in a genome base sequence

**Thoughts** I'm pleased with today's progress! I am now 1/4 of the way through the Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC.

### Day 4: 14.07.2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Wrote a function that finds the most frequent k-mers that cluster together into clumps in the genome
* Faced some technical issues and obstacles: 
  * Initially I wrote the function in a Jupyter notebook and it kept crashing 
  * I switched to Spyder and used file input to cut down on runtime
* Received a JetBrains IDE licence key from Stepik as a reward for solving a difficult code challenge

**Thoughts** I'm so delighted today - I did not expect the gift from Stepik! The satisfaction I feel after solving a difficult code challenge is a reward itself.
