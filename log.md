# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Course Links**
* [2020 Python Bootcamp - Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/)
* [Bioinformatics Algorithms - Stepik](https://stepik.org/course/2)

### Day 1: 10.07.2020

**Today's Progress**: 
* Learnt the basics of objects and data structures in Python
* Installed Anaconda and Jupyter
* Completed the first code challenge in the Bioinformatics Algorithms MOOC
  * Objective --> identify the number of times a k-mer appears in a base sequence when given the k-mer base sequence
* Wrote my first program in Python

**Thoughts** This is my first time coding. I spent many hours picking up the basic skills needed to approach and solve the bioinformatic code challenge. Finally solving the algorithm challenge was the perfect end to today.
